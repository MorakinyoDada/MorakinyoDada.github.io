    Quality Assurance Tester transitioning from aviation safety leadership into software quality
  </p>
</header>

<section id="about">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
I am an early-career Quality Assurance professional with over 15 years of experience in customer service and 
operational leadership across aviation, hospitality, and service-driven environments. 
My career has been shaped by roles that demanded precision, accountability, and consistent adherence to standards,
particularly in safety-critical and customer-facing operations.
</p>
<p>
Before transitioning into Quality Assurance, I served as a Senior Flight Attendant, Cabin Crew Supervisor, and Inflight Manager,
where I was responsible for enforcing operational procedures, supervising teams, managing incidents, and ensuring compliance in 
high-pressure, time-sensitive situations. These roles required structured thinking, detailed documentation, risk awareness, and 
clear communication, skills that closely align with modern QA practices.
</p>
  
  <p>
My transition into QA was intentional and skills-driven. I am currently building hands-on experience in manual testing, 
test planning, test case design, defect reporting, API testing, and SQL data validation. 
I approach quality with the mindset of understanding systems deeply, validating expected behavior thoroughly,
and communicating findings clearly to support product improvement. I bring a calm, methodical, 
and people-focused approach to QA, shaped by years of leadership, teamwork, and service excellence.

  <h2>Login Functionality – QA Case Study</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Context:</strong><br>
    This case study is based on an academic Quality Assurance project designed to
    simulate real-world testing practices. The objective was to validate the login
    functionality of a web application, focusing on correctness, error handling,
    and data integrity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Login is a high-risk feature because it controls user access, protects data,
    and directly impacts security and user trust. For this reason, testing was
    approached using both positive and negative scenarios.
  </p>

  <h3>Scope of Testing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>User interface validation (login form behavior)</li>
    <li>Input validation and error messaging</li>
    <li>API response validation</li>
    <li>Backend data verification using SQL</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Test Approach</h3>
  <p>
    A risk-based, black-box testing approach was used. Test cases were designed
    based on functional requirements and expected user behavior. Both valid and
    invalid credential scenarios were executed to ensure the system handled
    authentication correctly.
  </p>

  <h3>Test Scenarios Covered</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Login with valid username and password</li>
    <li>Login with invalid password</li>
    <li>Login with empty or missing fields</li>
    <li>System response to repeated failed login attempts</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Defects Identified</h3>
  <p>
    During execution, defects were identified related to missing input validation
    and unclear error messaging. Bug reports were documented with clear steps to
    reproduce, expected results, actual results, severity, and priority to support
    efficient resolution.
  </p>

  <h3>API and Database Validation</h3>
  <p>
    API testing was performed to validate authentication responses and HTTP status
    codes. SQL queries were used to confirm user status, failed login attempts, and
    last login timestamps, ensuring consistency between frontend behavior and backend data.
  </p>

  <h3>Outcome and Key Learnings</h3>
  <p>
    This case study strengthened my understanding of end-to-end QA workflows,
    including requirement analysis, structured test design, defect communication,
    and backend validation. It reinforced the importance of testing critical
    features thoroughly and documenting findings clearly to improve overall product quality.
